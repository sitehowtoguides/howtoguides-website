                <h3>Understanding AI Image Generation</h3>
                <p>
                  Midjourney is an AI image generation tool that creates images based on text descriptions (prompts) provided by users. Unlike traditional design software that requires manual creation, Midjourney uses artificial intelligence to interpret your text prompts and generate corresponding visuals, often with stunning and unexpected results.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                  At its core, Midjourney is powered by a diffusion model, a type of AI that gradually transforms random noise into coherent images based on the text guidance it receives. The system has been trained on billions of images and their associated descriptions, allowing it to understand complex concepts, artistic styles, lighting techniques, compositions, and more.
                </p>
                
                <ExpandableSection title="Evolution and Current Capabilities">
                  <p>
                    Since its public beta release in July 2022, Midjourney has evolved significantly. The current flagship model as of 2025 is Version 6, which offers dramatically improved photorealism, better text rendering, more accurate prompt following, and enhanced compositional understanding compared to earlier versions. Midjourney has also introduced specialized models like Niji for anime-style art and specialized parameters for different creative needs.

                <ExpandableSection title="Comparison with Other AI Image Generators">
                  <p>
                    Compared to other AI image generators like DALL-E 3 or Stable Diffusion, Midjourney offers a unique balance of artistic quality and photorealism, with particular strengths in creating atmospheric, emotionally evocative images with strong aesthetic appeal. While all these tools continue to improve rapidly, Midjourney remains distinctive for its artistic sensibility and the particular "look" of its outputs.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>
                    One key difference from other AI image generators is that Midjourney operates primarily through Discord, a communication platform popular with gamers and online communities. This unique approach creates a social, community-oriented experience where users can see each other's creations, share techniques, and learn collaboratively.

                  Getting started with Midjourney requires both a Discord account and a Midjourney subscription. If you don't already have a Discord account, you'll need to create one first:
                </p>
                
                <ol>
                  <li>Visit <a href="https://discord.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">discord.com</a> in your web browser</li>
                  <li>Click on the "Register" button</li>
                  <li>Enter your email address, username, password, and date of birth</li>
                  <li>Verify your email address by clicking the link sent to your inbox</li>
                  <li>Complete any additional verification steps if prompted</li>
                </ol>
                
                <p>
                  You can use Discord through your web browser, but for the best experience, consider downloading the Discord desktop application for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux) or the mobile app for iOS or Android.
